##How To Document Python Functions/Objects:

Each function and object should be documented with a docstring,
which is a description of the function/object placed as the first
statement of the function/object. The docstring is opened and closed
using triple quotes like:

def func():
	"""This is a docstring"""
	...

FUNCTIONS
=========
Each python function should contain a concise and informative
explaination of the following items:
	+ Short Description
	+ Detailed Description
	+ List of Parameters w/description
	+ List of Returns w/description

The format for this should be:

def add(x,y):
	"""
	Adds two numbers

	Adds two integers x and y together and returns the result

	Args:
		x (int): a number
		y (int): a number

	Returns:
		int: the sum of x and y
	"""
	return(x+y)


Each python object should contain a concise and informative
explaination of the following items:
	+ General Description
	+ Attributes w/Description

Given the following class:

	class Dog:

		def __init__(name, age):
			self.name = name
			self.age = age

		def bark():
			print("bark!\n")


The format for this should be:

	class Animal:
		"""
		This class desribes an Animal object
		
		Attribute:
			name (str): name of the animal
			age (int): age in years of the animal
			sound (str): sound the animal makes
		"""	

		def __init__(self, name, age, sound):
			"""
			The constructor for the Dog class
			"""
			self.name = name
			self.age = age
			self.sound = sound

		def bark(self):
			"""
			The function to output the sound of the animal
			"""
			print(self.sound+"\n")
