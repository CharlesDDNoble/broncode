To Do:
------
+ Overall design
+ Testing
  + Testing Plan
  + [Python Unit Test Framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
  + [Selenium for in browser testing](https://www.seleniumhq.org/)
+ Standards
  + ~~[Python Standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)~~
+ Software Tools
  + Django
    + ~~How does it work?~~
    + Change databases
  + Code Editor
    + ~~[Code Mirror](https://codemirror.net/)~~
      + ~~Find example page~~
  + Docker
    + ~~How to call Docker from python script~~
    + How to manage many Docker containers
    + ~~Returning info from a spawned Container~~
    + ~~[Python library](https://github.com/docker/docker-py)~~
    + ~~Time limit~~
    + ~~Test if there's any way to do anything persistent~~
  + [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)
  + Front End Framework
    + ~~[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)~~
    + Materialize

+ End of semester:
  + Single webpage
  + Tutorial text
  + Code editor for C
  + Stdin
  + Compile
    + Smarter parsing of command line args (extraneous spaces cause gcc to throw errors)
      e.g. "gcc -o code  -Wall    -Werror code.c" <- if there are extra spaces this doesn't work
    + More efficient update system, i.e. how to notify the script running in the docker
      container that the code files are now copied. Some type of push mechanic maybe??? 
  + Show results
  + Stretch goal: another language e.g. R
